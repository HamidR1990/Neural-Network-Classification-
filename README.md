# Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron) For Classification


##### This is python code for the neural network algorithm (MLP). In this little project, we design a multil layer perceptron to determine the label of an input sample. This label could have several value.




#### The main object of this project is to write an MLP algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

"iris" which is a traditional dataset in machine learning for classification tasks.
